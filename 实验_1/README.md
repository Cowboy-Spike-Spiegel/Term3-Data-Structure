# Garrison's number

Having read the issue , we assume that :

​	n >= 2 ;

​	y >= 1 ;

**x bases on your guess** .





### We choose **C++** to show our simulation process :

1. **Class Soldiers** , indicating that all the soldiers marked with **number from 1 to n .**

2. **Killing process** , send n and y , calculate x , and output them .





### We have many codes to solve this question :

Student 马天成 :

1. folder"**basic**" :

   1. "**Program_1.cpp**" : basic process with **single-cycle linked list**.

   2. "**Program_1_Trick.cpp**" : super one , which can **give you a situation of this process**.

      ​										 	   Please run it with heart .

2. folder"**upgrade**" :

   1. "**Program_2.cpp**" : basic process with **double-cycle linked list**.

   2. "**Program_2++.cpp**" : **upgrade in output** , and more formal than others .

      ​									  This code can be seen as our **PROJECT OUTCOMES**.

   3. "**Program_2++.h**" : header of the upper code.

3. folder"pictures" : the screenshots of our codes and outputs.



Student 黄洪健：

1. folder"**Test_Version**" :
   1. "**Program_1.c**": test version with all function, including **double-cycle list** , some formal   							 input and others.
   2. "**Program_1.h**": header of the code.
   3. folder"pictures" : the screenshots of our codes and outputs.
