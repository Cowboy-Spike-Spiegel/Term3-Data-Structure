# Binary-to-Octal Conversion

Having read the issue , we assume that :

**Input only include '0' and '1'.**





### We choose **C++** to show our simulation process :

1. **Class stack, **for getting the inverse string.
2. **Class queue** , for getting the sequence string.



# Palindrome String Judgment

Having read the issue , we assume that :

**There is no Chinese character in the input.**



### We choose **C++** to show our simulation process :

1. **Class stack_input, **input the binary number into stacks.
2. **Class stack_output** , output the octal number.

### We have many codes to solve these questions :

Student 马天成 :

1. folder"**Program_1**" :

   1. "**Program_1.cpp**" : basic process of binary-to-octal conversion.
   2. "**Program_1.h**" : header of the upper code
2. folder"**Program_2**" :

   1. "**Program_2.cpp**" : basic process of palindrome string judgment.

   2. "**Program_2.h**" : header of the upper code.
3. folder"pictures" : the screenshots of our codes and outputs.
